# Student Grade Tracker Project Overview
# Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a Python program that allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments.
It calculates the average grade, assigns a letter grade, and computes the GPA (Grade Point Average).
Features Implemented:
User inputs grades for six subjects (English, Maths, Science, Social, Physics, and Biology).
The program calculates the average grade using the provided grades.
It assigns a letter grade based on the average.
It converts the average grade to GPA using predefined ranges.
Components:
Input Collection: The program prompts the user to input grades for each subject.
Average Calculation: It computes the average grade across all subjects.
Letter Grade Assignment: Based on the average, it assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).
GPA Calculation: It converts the average grade to GPA using predefined ranges.
Additional Information:
The program displays the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.
It also calculates the percentage based on the average grade.
Next Steps:
You can further enhance the program by adding features like weighted grades, student names, and a graphical user interface (GUI).
